# Jasmine Intro Lab

Run `rails s` and check out `http://localhost:3000/specs`. You should see some failing Jasmine specs! Write code to make them pass, one spec at a time. The specs themselves are in `spec/javascripts` (you'll probably need to refer to these), and your code should go in the files located in `app/assets/javascripts`.
